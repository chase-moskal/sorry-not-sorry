			<p>Let's make a nice big leafy tree. The least little bit can do so much. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.</p>
			<p>That's a son of a gun of a cloud. All kinds of happy little splashes. You gotta think like a tree.</p>
			<p>The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. There comes a nice little fluffer. In life you need colors.</p>
			<p>Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Don't fight it, use what happens. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.</p>
			<p>But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.</p>
			<p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. It's cold, but it's beautiful. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.</p>
			<p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Be brave.</p>
			<p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Imagination is the key to painting. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.</p>
			<p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. This piece of canvas is your world. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>
			<p>It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.</p>
			<p>A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
			<p>If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Here's another little happy bush</p>
			<p>So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. You can get away with a lot. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Use what you see, don't plan it.</p>
			<p>We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.</p>
			<p>A fan brush can be your best friend. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Anyone can paint. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. We'll put a happy little sky in here.</p>
			<p>Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>
			<p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>
			<p>Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Nothing wrong with washing your brush. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.</p>
			<p>Just a little indication. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>
			<p>It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>
			<p>We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.</p>
			<p>Let that brush dance around there and play. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. You're meant to have fun in life. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.</p>
			<p>Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. With practice comes confidence. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.</p>
			<p>Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Learn when to stop. This is the fun part Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Just make a decision and let it go.</p>
			<p>The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. It is a lot of fun. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Take your time. Speed will come later.</p>
			<p>Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends.</p>
			<p>It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Anything you want to do you can do here. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife.</p>
